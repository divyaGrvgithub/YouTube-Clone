## 3. Getting Started ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

#### 1. Clone the Repository

To get a local copy of this repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/divyaGrvgithub/YouTube-Clone
```

#### 2. Navigate to the Project

Change your working directory to the project folder:

```sh
cd YouTube-Clone
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required packages using npm:

```sh
npm i
npm i -D tailwindcss
```
#### 4. API KEY Setup

To fetch YouTube data, you'll need the following `API_KEYS`. Follow these steps to set them up:

1. Obtain a **YouTube API key from Google** by visiting [Google Developers - Getting Started](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started). If you need detailed instructions, you can also refer to [How to Get a YouTube API Key](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-get-youtube-api-key).
2. Get a YouTube V3 API key from [Rapid API - YouTube V3](https://rapidapi.com/ytdlfree/api/youtube-v31). If you haven't used Rapid API before, you'll need to sign up after signup subscribe to the **YouTube V3 API** for free.

Once you have your API keys, proceed with the following:

3. Create a `.env` file in the `root` directory of your project.
4. Place your API key values in the `.env` file as shown below. Note that I've included two Google API keys as backups in case one exceeds its usage limits.

```sh
REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY_GOOGLE1=YOUR_API_KEY
REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY_GOOGLE2=YOUR_API_KEY
REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY_RAPIDAPI=YOUR_API_KEY
```

> Note :- The `REACT_APP` prefix is used to define environment variables in a React application. These variables are used during the build process and can be accessed in your code using `process.env.REACT_APP_VARIABLE_NAME`.


#### 5. Start the Project

Run the following command to launch the ReactJS project in your local environment:

```sh
npm start
```

#### 6. Access the Project

Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project.

That's it! You're now ready to explore the project locally.

Happy coding! üöÄ

## 4. Understand Context API üß† 

`YoutubeContext.js` is a context module designed to simplify the management of YouTube data in your React application. It leverages the power of React's Context API to provide a centralized state and functions for fetching and handling YouTube data.

Key Features:

- Fetch trending videos based on country code.
- Perform autocomplete suggestions for search queries.
- Retrieve search results for videos based on user queries.
- Efficiently handle API calls and loading states.
- I have incorporated a second API for generateAutocomplete suggestions due to the first API's lack of mobile screen support. However, the first API offers unlimited access on 
   desktop, which is why I decided to utilize both.
- For the functions getSearchVideos and getTrendingVideo, I implemented the second API as a backup. This arrangement ensures that when the first API exceeds its usage limit, 
  the second API can seamlessly take over and provide uninterrupted service. This approach enhances the reliability of the application and provides a smooth user experience.
